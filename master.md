### 4. Design System

#### Color Schemes by User Type
- **Industry**: Blue (`bg-blue-600`, `text-blue-600`)
- **Professional**: Green (`bg-green-600`, `text-green-600`)
- **Service Vendor**: Orange (`bg-orange-600`, `text-orange-600`)
- **Product Vendor**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-600`, `text-yellow-600`)
- **Logistics Vendor**: Pink (`bg-pink-600`, `text-pink-600`)

#### Component Patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Consistent Layout**: Header + Main content + Footer structure  
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and spinner components
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
